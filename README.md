# LeetCode-solutions

Each folder contains **bad** and **good** solution. I do the task myself first and then change to a better variant.

If the label is "**Destroyed ðŸ”¥**", it means that I have understood and puzzled the solution out so deeply that I can do this in the middle of the night with my eyes closed. Really.

Table with the solution complexity information:

| Task | Algorithmic complexity |    Memory    |
| ---- | ---------------------- |    ------    |
| 1    | O(N)                   | O(N)         |
| 2    | O(max(N, M))           | O(max(N, M)) |
| 121  | O(N)                   | O(1)         |
