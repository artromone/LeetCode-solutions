# LeetCode-solutions

Each folder contains **first** and **good** solution. I do the task myself first and then change to a better variant.

If the label is "**Destroyed ðŸ”¥**", it means that I have understood and puzzled the solution out so deeply that I can do this in the middle of the night with my eyes closed. Really.

Problem list: https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/. Tasks solved: **more than 50**.
